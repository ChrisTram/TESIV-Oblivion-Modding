; If higher than zero, you can only sell to the correct merchant type, but merchants will receive additional barter gold equal to this setting
set tnoEE.extraBarterGoldJourneyman to 1

; Fraction of money given to merchants for services (repair, training, recharging, etc.) that is returned to the merchant in form of barter gold
; 1 will make all the gold available as barter gold, less than 1 means that some of the gold is reserved for other means.
set tnoEE.merchantServicesReturn to 1

; Randomization factor of the merchant's base gold. 0 means no randomization, 0.5 means 50% randomization (a merchant that normally has 800 gold can have anything from 400-1200)
set tnoEE.start_random_factor to 0

; The part of the merchant's gold that will normally change during the day. 0.2 means that the merchant normally has 20% less gold in the morning than in the evening.
set tnoEE.time_factor to 0

; How much of the gold that changes during the day that will go above the merchant's base gold.
; With time_factor of 0.2, time_threshold of 0 means that a merchant with 1000 base gold goes from 800 to 1000.
; time_treshold of 0.2 means 840-1040, time_treshold of 0.5 means 900-1100 and time_treshold of 1 means 1000-1200.  
set tnoEE.time_threshold to 0

; Randomization factor of the gold the merchant receives during the day to simulate trade with NPCs.
; If the above settings result in a calculation that the merchant's gold should increase by 100 gold, update_random_factor will have the following effect:
; 0: increase by 100. 0.5: increase by 50-150. 1: increase by 0-200. 1.5: change by -50 - +250 2: change by -100 - +300.

; Enables auto haggle, i.e. that the game automatically gives you correct haggle values.
; If auto haggle is disabled, the global economy and detailed haggle settings get disabled too
set tnoEE.autoHaggle to 0

; Only used if Auto Haggle is disabled. Controls whether to use vanilla or Cutthroat Merchants haggle settings

set tnoEE.haggleLimit to 0

; Only used if Auto Haggle is disabled and haggleLimit is enabled.
; Controls the effect additional haggle attempts (after haggleLimit is reached) will have on the merchant's disposition, in percent of its current disposition.
; If 0, you will not be able to haggle at all after haggleLimit has been reached.
set tnoEE.haggleDispositionFactor to 5


; ================== Settings to control Auto Haggle: =====================

; Set minimum and maximum sell percentages
set tnoEE.sellMin to 10
set tnoEE.sellMax to 80

; Set minimum and maximum buy percentages
set tnoEE.buyMin to 150
set tnoEE.buyMax to 300

; Set the factors that decide whether min, max or somewhere in between is used. The numbers decide the factors strengths
; Default (4-4-2) means that the Merchant's and the Player's mercantile skills each counts twice as much as the Merchant's disposition
set tnoEE.merchantFactor to 4
set tnoEE.playerFactor to 4
set tnoEE.dispositionFactor to 2

; Example: Merchant's mercantile skill is 30. Player's mercantile skill is 50. Merchant's disposition is 80.
; Adjustment value will then be: [4*(100-30) + 4*50 + 2*80] / [100*(4+4+2)] = 0.64
; Assume sellmin/max = 10-60 and buymin/max = 200-300
; sell% will then be: 10 + (60-10)*0.64 = 42%
; buy% will then be: 300 - (300-200)*0.64 = 236% 

; Enables or disables the 100% sell/buy effect of the Mercantile master perk. 
; If the effect is disabled (0), a master will use sellMax and buyMin instead, but merchants will still receive additional barter gold.
set tnoEE.useMasterPerk to 1


; ================== Settings to control Real Values: =====================

; Enable or disable real, decimal values during barter, instead of rounded-up values (Requires MenuQue)
; Values are:
; 0: Disable real values
; 1-3: Enable real values, and display real value for an item when you move the mouse over it.
; 	1: Auto-detect UI colors, 2: Standard UI colors, 3: Dark UI colors.
set tnoEE.realValue to 0

; Set normal barter chatter amount. 7 is closest to vanilla. 4 will be half of it
set EEBarterChatter to 7

; Set special person's barter chatter amount. 50 is close to vanilla. 25 will be half of it.
set EEbarterChatterSpecial to 50


; ================== Settings to control value-based mercantile leveling =====================

; Set mercantile leveling mode:
; 0: disabled
; 1: As 2, except that each sale will count as at least one skill use, even when selling a low-value item.
; 2: (Recommended) Skill gain is dependent on transaction value only, so sale of a low-value item will count as a fraction of a skill use, while sellinh a high-value item may count as several skill uses.
; 3: Each transaction gives the same number of skill uses as the number of items (Selling 50 arrows in one transaction counts as 50 skill uses).
set tnoEE.mercSkillMode to 2

; Used in mode 1&2, mercSkillSellModifier tells how much gold you must sell for, to count as one skill use
; When selling an item, the calculated number of skill uses will then be: (Gold received) / (mercSkillSellModifier*[current sell percentage])
; Ex: Selling an item for 150 gold, at 75% with mercSkillSellModifier 50, will give you 150 / (50*0.75) = 4 skill uses.
set tnoEE.mercSkillSellModifier to 20

; Used in mode 1&2, mercSkillBuyModifier tells how much gold you must buy for, to count as one skill use
; Set to 0 to disable mercantile experience when buying items
set tnoEE.mercSkillBuyModifier to 40

; Used in mode 1&2, mercLevelAdjustment controls how the skill gain is slowed down when your player level increases, to counter the fact that the items you find are generally worth more.
; mercLevelAdjustment sets how much more gold you need per transaction for each level increase.
; Setting it to 10 means that you need 10% more gold for each level the player gains.
; The final calculated number of skill uses will then be (calculated uses - see above) / [(1+mercLevelAdjustment/100) ^ (player level-1)],
; Player level is never considered above 25 for this calculation (since you don't find much better loot above level 25).
; Ex:
; 0: No modification due to player level
; 5: divide by (1.05^4) = 1.2 when at level 5, (1.05^9) = 1.6 when at level 10, (1.05^24) = 3.2 when at level 25 or above.
; 7: divide by (1.07^4) = 1.3 when at level 5, (1.07^9) = 1.8 when at level 10, (1.07^24) = 5.1 when at level 25 or above.
; 10: divide by (1.1^4) = 1.5 when at level 5, (1.1^9) = 2.4 when at level 10, (1.1^24) = 9.8 when at level 25 or above.
; 15: divide by (1.15^4) = 1.7 when at level 5, (1.15^9) = 3.5 when at level 10, (1.15^24) = 28.6 when at level 25 or above.
set tnoEE.mercLevelAdjustment to 10

; So, in mode 1&2, if you sell an item worth 1000 gold with default settings, the experience gained will be:
; At level 5: (1000/20) / (1.1^4) = 50 / 1.5 = 34 skill uses
; At level 10: (1000/10) / (1.1^9) = 50 / 2.4 = 21 skill uses
; At level 25: (1000/10) / (1.1^24) = 50 / 9.8 = 5 skill uses

; Used in mode 3 only, mercSellItemAdjustment controls the reduction in experience gained when selling many items at once.
; The skill uses will be (number of items sold) ^ mercSkillSellModifier, so set it to 1 to gain the same amount of experience when selling many items at once
; Set it to 0.95 to gain (20^0.95) = 17 skill uses when selling 20 arrows at once, or (50^0.95) = 41 skill uses for selling 50.
; Set it to 0.9 to gain (20^0.9) = 15 skill uses when selling 20 arrows at once, or (50^0.9) = 34 skill uses for selling 50.
; Set it to 0.8 to gain (20^0.8) = 11 skill uses when selling 20 arrows at once, or (50^0.8) = 23 skill uses for selling 50.
set tnoEE.mercSellItemAdjustment to 0.9

; Used in mode 3 only, mercSellItemAdjustment controls the reduction in experience gained when buying one or more items at once.
; Works similar to mercSellItemAdjustment, except that setting it to 0 completely disables mercantile experience when buying items
set tnoEE.mercBuyItemAdjustment to 0

set tnoEE.disablePriceDialogue to 0


; ================== Settings to control house taxes =====================

; If you set this to 0.5, you will have to pay 15,000x0.5/100 = 75 gold per week for the Cheydinhal house with vanilla house prices,
; and 70,000x0.5/100 = 350 gold per week with OOO prices

; Set the direct maximum gold reward for helping a merchant, though a merchant can never pay more than his current barter gold..
; The average reward will be half of the possible maximum.
set tnoEE.merchantQuests_maxGoldReward to 200

; Set the random chance distribution for which of the possible locations a quest item is found in.
; Chance of finding it in a location is 1/(NoRL ^ questLocationChance), where NoRL is Number of Remaining Locations.
; 1.0 means equal chance for all locations. (chance is 1/NoRL)
; 0 means that the item is always in the first location entered. (Chance is 1/1)
; 1.5 (default) means that the chance if 3 locations is distributed close to 0.2/0.3/0.5 - thus 50% for it being in the last location found.
set tnoEE.questLocationChance to 1

; Set the random chance distribution for which of the possible containers a quest item is found in.
; Chance of finding it in a container is 1/(NoRC ^ questContainerChance), where NoRC is Number of Remaining Containers.

; 1.3 means that the chance of the item being in the last of 10 containers is about 23%.
set tnoEE.questContainerChance to 1.2

; EE has two ways to set up variable dialogue text.
; Some players encounter CTD when starting/ending dialogues with the "standard" way, 
; So by default, the alternate way is used, even though it add one superfluous space in the dialogue.
