# Description

I'll add content from my Oblivion mods here. More on Nexus mod or La Confr√©rie Des Traducteurs.

## WaterDragonScaleEdit.esp

The goal of this mod is to edit the alchemy attributes of the scales of the Water Dragon from the Creature Diversity mod.

I didn't reduce the gold value (which is honestly maybe still way too high) but I removed the feather effect (in first position) which was OP for me (It was making the creation of feather potion too simple). I put a lightning attribute instead.

Creature Diversity from Zaldir is of course needed, otherwise my mod will have no effect. Place my mod below it in the load order.
